In the United States, there is a school called Western Kentucky University.
Every spring since 2007, they've taught a class called Computational Problem
Solving (usually taught by Claus Ernst and Uta Zeigler) where students learned
_Mathematica_ and did solved problems and made projects.

This is a small repository to remember some of the old assignments. It would
be cool to make this bigger, adding more old assignments and projects.
