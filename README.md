In the United States, there is a school called Western Kentucky University.
Every spring since 2007, they've taught a class called Computational Problem
Solving (usually taught by Claus Ernst and Uta Zeigler) where students learned
_Mathematica_ and did solved problems and made projects.

This is a small repository to remember some of the old assignments. It would
be cool to make this bigger, adding more old assignments and projects.

Please follow the format of the existing files. Project folder should be Name & Name, in alphabetical order by last name, with inner folder the group's project folder (titled after the project).
